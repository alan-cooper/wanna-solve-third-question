## Three Issues of the Night: Bed, Biscuits, and Bemusement

One night, I found myself grappling with a series of rather amusing sleep "issues." My smartphone was perilously close to my face, hanging over my head like the Sword of Damocles. It seemed one tiny twitch would send it plummeting straight onto my nose.

There I am in the middle of the night like a sleepless Batman who was smack in the middle of an endless chess game, after a great night dinner as Poori with Milk. The pieces on the board taunted me with their unwavering stalemate, presenting yet another of my nocturnal "issues."

My stomach, however, was the Joker in this nocturnal saga. It announced its presence with a guttural growl, akin to the maniacal laughter of Gotham's most notorious clown. I rolled to the cupboard, pondering my snack choice to resolve my food-related "issue": biscuits or fruits.

The night ticked on, the biscuits disappeared faster than a getaway car, and sleep remained as elusive as the Riddler's latest riddle, compounding my sleep-related "issues."
